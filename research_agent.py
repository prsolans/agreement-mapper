Company Scale:

The matrix will use:
- X-axis: Volume (how frequently the agreement type is used/signed) - Scale 1-10
- Y-axis: Complexity (clauses, stakeholders, legal review, customization) - Scale 1-10

Identify the top 20 agreement types most relevant to {company_name} based on their industry, operations, and common practices. Include both internal (within company) and external (with customers, vendors, regulators) agreements.

For EACH agreement type, provide in JSON format:
- type: Agreement type name (e.g., "Non-Disclosure Agreements", "Master Service Agreements")
- volume: Numeric score 1-10 (1=rarely used, 5=moderate, 10=used constantly)
- complexity: Numeric score 1-10 (1=simple template, 5=moderate negotiation, 10=highly complex/customized)
- classification: "Internal" or "External"
- business_unit: Primary owner (e.g., "Legal", "HR", "Sales", "Procurement", "Operations", "IT", "Finance")
- description: Brief 1-sentence description of this agreement type
- estimated_annual_volume: Approximate number per year (e.g., "500+", "2,000+")

Also provide:
- matrix_metadata:
  - total_types: Count of agreement types
  - highest_volume_type: Name of agreement with highest volume
  - highest_complexity_type: Name of agreement with highest complexity
  - quadrant_distribution: Count in each quadrant (high_vol_high_complex, high_vol_low_complex, low_vol_high_complex, low_vol_low_complex)

Base suggestions on what is typical for companies in this industry if exact internal details are unavailable.

Return as valid JSON with structure:
